  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear implemented via a new admin no-auth mode flag and updates to AdminGuard and AdminLoginPage to bypass Internet Identity/admin checks and allow direct entry to /admin. Backend changes required for REQ-3 are not evidenced in the provided (truncated) backend diff summary, so implementation of permission-bypass for admin-only endpoints cannot be confirmed. Several unrelated frontend changes/utilities appear added/modified that were not requested by the BuildRequest.",

      "requirement": "Temporarily disable backend admin permission enforcement for all admin-only endpoints so admin UI operations work for an unauthenticated/anonymous caller while temporary no-auth mode is enabled.",
      "reason": "The backend diff shown is truncated and does not include any visible changes demonstrating that admin-only methods (e.g., getAllOrders, updateOrderStatus, products/offers CRUD, customers list/detail) no longer enforce admin authorization. No explicit evidence of bypass/removal of admin checks is present in the provided snippet.",
